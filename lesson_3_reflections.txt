When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are sharing your work with others and all need to work / make changes on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    ?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks = new branch on GitHub
    Clone = copy of repository either from GitHub or local
    Branch = code fork on local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that you can check for updates on remote and diff/merge while offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Not sure what would be easier, but email or cloud storage would be hard without version control

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would put changes in a separate branch if I made some changes that I wanted feedback on before merging back into the main branch
