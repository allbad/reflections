How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It cut down the amount of time to look for the bug and also helped make sure I didn't miss any either

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to see where things might have gone awry and track back to that version to start correcting things

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually better because you know at the time you are committing how far you got to, but there could be errors in automated commits, however you have to think about doing commits manually whereas you shouldn't lose too much with automated commits should something go wrong

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that you can see which files formed part of the same project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use them to check what was removed from or added to one version and the next

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing I could always roll back to a last known good

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For adding my work on nanoDegree course as there will be quite a lot of it over the coming months
